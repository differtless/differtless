Automatic differentiation (AD) is a computational approach that automatically finds the derivatives of a function using a computer program. For a given function, the AD software should be able to compute the derivatives of any order with machine precision. Through the computation of the Jacobian matrix and gradients, we are also able to optimize. \n\nAutomatic differentiation differs from classical methods such as symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation in that the AD method requires much less computational time and is not affected by numerical instability.\n\n\nDiffertless is a software package for performing AD, with additional functionality for performing optimization to find stationary points of functions. Our goal is to make automatic differentiation effortless!\n\n## Background\nAutomatic differentiation is based on the decomposition of differentials using chain rule. Separated by the order of chain rule calculation, AD can be divided into two modes: forward mode and reverse mode. The forward mode calculates derivatives from the inner function to the outer function using chain rule repeatedly, while the reverse mode calculates from outside to inside. \nWe can also say the forward mode calculates the product of the function's Jacobian matrix $J$ with the seed vectors specified by input variables, while reverse modes computes the product of the transpose of Jacobian matrix $J^T$ with  seed vectors. In a function with $m$ inputs and $n$ functions, represented by $R^m \\rightarrow R^n$, forward mode is more efficient when $n$ >> $m$, while reverse mode is more efficient when $n$ << $m$.\n\nFor our extension, we implemented optimization functionality for `numpy` and `scipy` mathematical operations, probability distributions, and spatial functions. `numpy` and `scipy` are popular open-source libraries for Python featuring a large collection of high-level numerical computing tools and modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, and special functions for tasks common in science and engineering.\nThere are many useful applications of AD in this realm: for example, AD is often used within the context of Bayesian parameter inference for sampling from the posterior using methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, where one needs to be able to take the gradients of probability distributions. \n\nThus, we implemented the probability and cumulative distribution functions of commonly used statistical distributions such as the Normal, Poisson and Gamma distributions. When performing parameter inference in this manner, users often work with the logarithms of the functions to prevent overflow or underflow errors – thus we also implemented the log PDFs and log CDFs of all these distributions. We note that a lot of this functionality is not available in other AD packages like autograd.\n\nWe hope that differtless will be a convenient way for users in a range of disciplines to integrate AD into their already-established workflows, without having to redefine functions they would typically use packages like numpy and scipy for, and without having to modify their pipeline to incorporate optimization routines.\n\nA computational graph is useful in visualizing the propagation of elementary operations that construct the function to be auto-differentiated. From here, it is easy to evaluate the numerical value after each operation, the derivatives of the elementary operations, and numerical values of derivatives with respect to each input variable.\n\nFor an example function \n\n$$\nf(x,y)=\n\\left[\n\\begin{matrix}\nc_1 & c_2\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right]\n\\left[\n\\begin{matrix}\nw_{11} & w_{12} \\\\\nw_{21} & w_{22}\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right]\n\\left[\n\\begin{matrix}\nx  \\\\\ny\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right]\n\n$$\n\nThe computational graph is \n![computational_graph](comp.png)\n\nThe evaluation trace is \n![trace](trace.png)\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"cell_id":"00001-9e09f66f-274d-4af8-8777-9096597bdc12","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How to use Differtless\n\nDiffertless is available from PyPI via `pip install differtless`\n\n`differtless` can also be obtained by `git clone https://github.com/differtless/cs107-FinalProject.git`\n\nIf a user obtained `differtless` from github, they can install the package by running `pip install .`\n\nIn both cases, package requirements are provided and checked for via `setup.py` \n\n    # example github installation\n    >> git clone https://github.com/differtless/cs107-FinalProject.git\n    >> cd cs107-FinalProject\n    >> pip install .\n    \n\nOnce the user has downloaded differtless they can run `from differtless import ad` and `import differtless.operations as op` in their driver script. Then when they have a function that they would like to automatically differentiate, they will: \n\n1. Define the function, using either elementary operations (which we have overloaded- add, subtract, etc) or `differtless` operations for elementary functions (e.g. `op.sin`, `op.exp`)\n    * The user may also define multiple functions (NOTE: all functions must have the same parameters, regardless of whether they are used in the body of the function)\n2. User defines inputs and optional seed\n    * Scalar inputs: \n        * Single scalars may be in the form of a number or `list` containing one number\n        * Multiple scalars must be input as a `list` or `tuple`\n    * Vector inputs:\n        * Single and multiple vectors must both be defined as a list of lists or tuple of tuples\n        * Ex. `x = [[1,2,3]]`\n    * Seed must be in `list` form (or list of lists)\n3. User calls the forward function with their pre-defined function (or list of functions), inputs, and seeds.\n    * This includes the preprocessing step.\n    * NOTE: the seed matrix is optional, if no seed is specified the seed will be the appropriate identity matrix\n    * This will return the value and corresponding derivatives.\n4. User can also call `ad.minimize`, `ad.root`, or `ad.least_squares` to utilize optimization functionality \n    * users can also call on probability distributions (such as Normal, Poisson, Gaussian)  and the special functions overloaded in the `operations` module\n\n\n##### Example: \n\n    from differtless import ad\n    import differtless.operations as op\n\n    # Define a function and provide inputs/seeds\n\n    def f1(x, y, z):\n        return x*y + op.exp(z)\n\n    def f2(x, y , z):\n        return (op.exp(x/y) + z)/y\n\n    # scalar inputs\n    inputs = [1,2,3]\n    seeds = [[42, 1, 1], [2, 42, 2], [3, 3, 42]]\n\n    # vector inputs\n    inputs = [[3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6]]\n    seeds = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n    # Run automatic differentiation\n    f1_ad = ad.forward(f1, inputs, seeds)\n\n    # Run AD with vector-valued function\n    f1_f2_ad = ad.forward([f1, f2], inputs, seeds)\n\n    # minimizing solution\n    min_sol = ad.minimize(f1, [2, 3, 4])\n\n    print(f'Function value: {f1_ad.value}')\n    print(f'Function derivatives: {f1_ad.gradients}')\n    print(f'Function Jacobian: {ad.Jacobian(f1, inputs)}')\n    print(f'Optimization minima solution: {min_sol}')\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"cell_id":"00002-278d3f27-5be6-432e-9a61-b6ccde478406","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Full Functionality Demo: also available as demo.ipynb\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-c290ded2-471b-408a-8504-a0d3f4559bde","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-01c9a38a-ffe4-4049-93f2-bd0b83d1e038","output_cleared":true,"source_hash":null,"execution_start":1607713345250,"execution_millis":75,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"### import differtless ###\nfrom differtless import ad\nimport differtless.operations as op\n\n### define inputs of interest ###\n# scalar input\nsingle_scalar = [5]\n# multiple scalar inputs (include seed)\nmulti_scalar = [2,3,4]\n# vector input\nsingle_vector = [[4,5,6]]\n# multiple vector inputs\nmulti_vector = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\n# seed matrix for multivariable functions\nmulti_seed = [[42,1,1],[2,42,1],[3,3,42]]\n\n### define functions of interest ###\n# single-variable functions\ndef single_f1(x):\n    return op.exp(op.sin(x) ** 2)\ndef single_f2(x):\n    return op.log(2 / x) -

Although the technical details for how the minima of these functions may feel far removed from any potential negative intent, it is vital to remove our rose-colored glasses and remember that technology is never created in a void. \n\nImagine, for example a machine learning algorithm for which we have determined a loss function- the most obvious way to get the best model would then be to minimize the loss function, potentially via our AD package. That's in large part because as computer scientists, our understandings of what makes a model the \"best\" focus accuracy metrics as optimized via a loss function. However, for models with real-world impact, they need to be both **accurate and fair**. These are two separate objectives with different metrics of success- accuracy may be measured by our loss function, but fairness requires a deeper dive:  understanding the pre-existing biases in our dataset, comparing the accuracy/false positive/false negative rates between any protected groups. \nWhen accuracy is too heavily optimized, the real-world impacts can be grave. The effects of algorithmic bias have caused it to be harder for certain minority groups to be hired under the same qualifications (2), and in the contexts of facial recognition systems, at the expense of ethical introspection, these algorithms are known to have lower accuracy on people of color and have caused the unnecessary and traumatic arrests of innocent men of color in the U.S. (4) and the tracking and controlling of the Uighur minority group in China (1).\n\nHowever, there are still strong motivations for pursuing this type of work and potential positive impacts. Recently, in academic fields such as flow topology (5) and aerodynamic design frameworks (6), automatic differentiation have been used to advance the understanding of necessary and previouisly less understood problems.\n\nMarginalized groups are still severely underrepresented in tech, and this disparity is even more apparent in the open source community. \nFor example, a Toptal study (7) found that in their random sample, just 5.4% of GitHub users with >10 contributions are female.\nTo this end, we've attempted to address this subtle barriers in order to make our repo as welcoming and inclusive as possible. The first step we took to make clear that all backgrounds belong here in our contributing community was to develop an Inclusion Statement to reflect our commitment to fostering a welcoming community. This is one of the first things that users will see in our repo. \n\nFor our software project, our code contribution is as transparent as possible. Pull requests can be approved and reviewed by any member of our team, and if there is any concern about a PR being approved, a group discussion is initiated to ensure proper vetting and open communication is maintained. \nIt is also worth mentioning that our (randomly assigned) team brings a diverse array of perspectives- both from an internal diversity viewpoint (gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) but also from an academic background viewpoint. We represent a variety of fields and a range of programs under the Harvard umbrella.\nThis is important to note since as Anna-Chiara suggests in the Toptal study, projects that show diversity in their leadership promote a culture of inclusivity within its contributors. \nWe recognize, however, that there are still barriers to certain groups that we have not yet accounted for. One of these is how non-native English speakers will interact with our code. Our entire documentation and examples are written in English, and so if given more time, we would want to make sure there is access to accurately translated versions of our documentation (or at least that it is Google Translate friendly).\n\n\n\n1. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html\n2. https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/1/21043000/artificial-intelligence-job-applications-illinios-video-interivew-act\n3. https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958953/apple-credit-card-gender-discrimination-algorithms-black-box-investigation\n4. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html\n5. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-017-1708-2\n6. https://www.ercoftac.org/downloads/bulletin-docs/ercoftac_bulletin_102.pdf \n7. https://www.toptal.com/open-source/is-open-source-open-to-women ","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-ad74c306-724f-4fcc-ab4e-e32b0cbf3d37","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Future Work\n\nAs a future direction for this work, there a few key areas we would like to expand on. \n\nOne logical next step would be to implement reverse mode.
